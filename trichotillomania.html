            <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder)</h1>
            <p>Trichotillomania, also known as trich or TTM, is when someone cannot resist the urge to pull out their hair.</p>

            <p>They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes.</p>

            <p>Trich usually starts between the ages of 10 and 13 years old.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms of Trichotillomania</h2>

            <p>People with trich feel an intense urge to pull their hair out and they experience growing tension until they do. After pulling their hair out, they feel a sense of relief.</p>

            <p>A person may sometimes pull their hair out in response to a stressful situation, or it may be done without really thinking about it.</p>

            <p>Most people with trich pull out hair from their scalp, but some pull out hair from other areas, such as their:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Eyebrows</li>
                <li>Eyelashes</li>
                <li>Genital area</li>
                <li>Beard or moustache</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bald patches on the head may have an unusual shape and affect one side of the head more than the other.</p>

            <p>Trich may cause feelings of shame and low self-esteem. Those affected may try to keep their condition to themselves.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Trichotillomania</h2>

            <p>It's not entirely clear what causes trich. It could be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your way of dealing with stress or anxiety</li>
                <li>A chemical imbalance in the brain</li>
                <li>Changes in hormone levels during puberty</li>
                <li>Genetic - more than one person in a family may have the condition</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For some people, hair pulling can be a habit that's hard to break. The more they pull their hair out, the more they want to keep doing it.</p>

            <h2>When to See a GP</h2>

            <p>See your GP if you're pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is doing this.</p>

            <p>You should also see your GP if you or your child has a habit of eating hair. This can cause hairballs to form in the stomach, leading to serious illness.</p>

            <p>Your GP may examine areas where the hair is missing to check that nothing else is causing the hair to come out, such as a skin infection.</p>

            <p>If your GP thinks you have trich, you may be referred for a type of treatment called <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/">cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</a></p>

            <p>If you are under 18, this may be offered through your local <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/children-and-young-adults/mental-health-support/mental-health-services/">children and young people's mental health services.</a></p>

            <h2>Treating Trichotillomania</h2>

            <p>Trich is commonly treated using a type of CBT called habit reversal training.</p>

            <p>This aims to help you replace a bad habit with something that's not harmful. Treatment usually involves:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Keeping a diary of your hair pulling</li>
                <li>Working out the triggers for your hair pulling and learning how to avoid them</li>
                <li>Replacing hair pulling with another action, like squeezing a stress ball</li>
                <li>Loved ones providing emotional support and encouragement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Antidepressants are not usually prescribed to treat trich.</p>

            <h2>Things You Can Try Yourself</h2>

            <p>Here are some tips from people with trich that may help when you feel the urge to pull your hair:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Squeeze a stress ball or something similar</li>
                <li>Form a ball with your fist and tighten the muscles in that arm</li>
                <li>Use a fidget toy</li>
                <li>Wear a bandana or a tight-fitting hat, such as a beanie</li>
                <li>Take a soothing bath to ease any stress or anxiety</li>
                <li>Practise deep breathing until the urge to pull goes away</li>
                <li>Exercise</li>
                <li>Put plasters on your fingertips</li>
                <li>Cut your hair short</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Support</h2>

            <p>It may also help to open up about your trich to people you trust, as hiding it can sometimes make your anxiety worse.</p>

            <p>Many people who have learned to manage their trich say that speaking to others about the condition led to a reduction in hair pulling.</p>

            <p>There is information on treatments and self-help advice on the <a href="https://www.ocduk.org">OCD UK website</a>.</p>
